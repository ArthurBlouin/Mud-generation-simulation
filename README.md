# Mud-generation-simulation
Gives the results of the simulations of mud generation processes at the Absheron location, results presented as a companion paper of Blouin et al., 2019 (DOI 10.1029/2018JF004872)

SeCoV3 contains the input files and software used for the 1D sedimentation-related overpressure modeling and also the output file
geometry contains the input files and software used to model the 2D geometry used un the 2D diffusion model and also the output files
Diffusion presents the output files of the 4 2D diffusion simulations presented
Navier-Stokes - 1D extrapolation gives the excel file used to extrapolate the 2D Navier-Stokes simulations for mud remobilization

Please read the other readme.txt files present in the different folders that will guide you in the results
